# CSV Data Analysis & Visualization

This application allows users to upload a CSV file, analyze its contents, and generate insightful visualizations using Plotly Express. The app is built with Streamlit and leverages an AI assistant to generate Python code for visualizations based on user queries.

## Features

- Upload and preview CSV files
- Generate visualizations based on user queries
- Display generated Python code and visualizations
- Supports various types of visualizations including scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and more

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/akashxlr8/ravian2.git
    cd ravian2
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python3.12 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up environment variables:
    - Create a [.env](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) file in the root directory and add the following variables:
        ```
        AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=<your-azure-openai-deployment>
        AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your-azure-openai-endpoint>
        AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-azure-openai-api-key>
        ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Upload a CSV file and enter a query to generate visualizations.
## Sample Datasets to test app
The repository includes sample datasets in the `sample_datasets` directory:

1. `mba_decision_dataset.csv`: A dataset containing information about students' decisions to pursue an MBA
    - Features: Age, Work Experience, Gender, Family Background, Academic Performance
    - Target Variable: MBA Decision (Yes/No)

Similary there are different datasets in the folder

The datasets are clean and ready for analysis, making them ideal for testing the application's visualization capabilities.

## Example Queries

- "How does gender distribute in decision to pursue MBA?"
- "Create a scatter plot using the two most correlated numerical columns."
- "Create a histogram for the most frequent categorical column."
